My name's Christian, and I'm about as regular as it gets. I work for a tech
company and I write sh\*tty code (probably). I enjoy a good beer and my dad's old
rock/grunge. I like to think deeply about questions I'll never know the answer
to. I am from the midwestern United States.

If you'd like to contact me and have something important to say, please send me
a PGP encrypted email to cdelliott96 (at) gmail (dot) com. Of course, I accept
communication from anyone, I just may not open your links if I don't know you. ‚ò∫

Here is my PGP fingerprint:

```text
8D2D 37DE F5DE CF38 DDDD  4315 8E72 EDFF 29CF 4310
```

and [here](/main-pub.key) is my PGP public key. üîê
