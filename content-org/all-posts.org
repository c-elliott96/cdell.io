# For some reason, I think the global #+hugo_auto_set_lastmod: t
# file setting was causing my Emacs to freeze. It's still freezing. 
# Can't figure out why, but it definitely started (and seems to be
# related to) when I added the auto set lastmod stuff.

# To answer the above remark, it only freezes if I do not have :EXPORT_DATE: set
# in a post I attempt to export

* Notes
** Latex preview PNGs
  My PNGs that are the LaTeX preview from ORG/* are showing up in this
  =cdell.io/static/ltximg= when I run =org-hugo-export-wim-to-md=.

  Note: a temporary workaround for this dilemma is to .gitignore
  =static/ltximg/*=, but this will likely interfere with embedded LaTeX in
  Github Pages

  The real concern here is committing content that is not intended for a
  publicly facing repo, as Github Pages /must/ be.
** Known issues
- It looks like changing tags/categories will break a running server, locally.
- Tags can't contain hyphens
  - Can they be escaped?
** Where does a file export to?
By default, files will export to =/posts=.
Override this through a number of avenues:
- Set =org-hugo-default-section-directory= to something else
- Configure it file-wide with =#+hugo_section:= front-matter
- Configure it per subtree with =:EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION:=

My name's Christian, and I'm about as regular as it gets. I work for a tech
company and I write sh*tty code (probably). I enjoy a good beer and my dad's old
rock/grunge. I like to think deeply about questions I'll never know the answer
to. I am from the midwestern United States.

If you'd like to contact me and have something important to say, please send me
a PGP encrypted email to cdelliott96 (at) gmail (dot) com. Of course, I accept
communication from anyone, I just may not open your links if I don't know you. üëçüèΩ

I am still trying to figure out the topic for my very first post. I'm sure that,
in hindsight, it won't matter. Starting is usually more important than how you
actually start. But paralysis by analysis is kind of my thing, so.

Before I really get too far into coming up with potential topics for this first
post, I should probably try to narrow down what this blog is going to be about
in general. If nothing else, I just want this blog to represent /me/. I want it
to be organic and authentic. Given I'm a human being that is always evolving,
that means this blog's whole state is going to be dynamic. Maybe it's ok that I
don't come up with a concrete focus and theme.

I think I've just finished my first blog post. It's only downhill from here!

Cheers.
