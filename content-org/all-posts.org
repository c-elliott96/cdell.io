# To add automatic timestamp updates to a subtree, add

# to the properties
# For some reason, I think the global #+hugo_auto_set_lastmod: t
# file setting was causing my Emacs to freeze. It's still freezing. 
# Can't figure out why, but it definitely started (and seems to be
# related to) when I added the auto set lastmod stuff.

* Notes
** Latex preview PNGs
  My PNGs that are the LaTeX preview from ORG/* are showing up in this
  =cdell.io/static/ltximg= when I run =org-hugo-export-wim-to-md=.

  Note: a temporary workaround for this dilemma is to .gitignore
  =static/ltximg/*=, but this will likely interfere with embedded LaTeX in
  Github Pages

  The real concern here is committing content that is not intended for a
  publicly facing repo, as Github Pages /must/ be.
** Known issues
- It looks like changing tags/categories will break a running server, locally.
- Tags can't contain hyphens
  - Can they be escaped?
